The code in crossmatch.py performs crossmatching between the SDSS/unwise csv files and the panSTARRS csv files matching on the panSTARRS ID number
At this stage I do not consider source duplicates or angular separation, but these will be performed in a separate filtering code which will drop non primary detections, and set a maximum separation
